# Car Damage Detection using Deep Learning

This project uses MobileNetV2 with TensorFlow/Keras to detect if a car is damaged based on images. It uses transfer learning for high accuracy and has been trained on a dataset of vehicle images.

## Features
- Binary classification: Damaged vs. Whole
- Transfer learning (MobileNetV2)
- Trained on a real-world dataset
- Saved model for reuse (`car_damage_model.h5`)

## Files
- `car_damage_detection.ipynb` – Training notebook (Google Colab)
- `car_damage_model.h5` – Saved trained model

## Tools Used
- Python, TensorFlow, Keras
- Google Colab, Matplotlib
